Description: serac allows the user to compute age-depth model and provide an output graph, as well as age model in a text file and metadata, on the free open-source statistical software R.
    serac ensure the reproducibility of age-depth model, and grant the possibility to test several 210Pbex models (CFCS, CIC, CRS) and sedimentation hypotheses (change in sedimentation rates, instantaneous deposits, varved sedimentation, etc.).
